A fault-tolerant implementation of the Huffman Coding algorithm, the primary compression algorithm
used in ZIP file formats. 
GUI built with JavaFX allows the user to choose files from their system to be compressed and/or 
decompressed. 
This project incorporated a number of programming problem areas, including:
- data structures (the Huffman Tree Algorithm)
- Serialization (writing and reading compressed representations to and from txt files)
- UI/UX design (the GUI)
